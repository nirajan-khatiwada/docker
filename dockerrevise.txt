To make a container from image
->docker run image

To make container from image and run in interative mode(-it)
->docker run -it image
->the terminal of the container will we opened after building the container

To make container with name 
->docker run --name name image







Port mapping
->docker run -p computerport:dockerport image
->to map computer port with docker port.The incomming request at the computerport will redirect to docker container port

Background running
->docker run -d image
->to run builded container in background

passing env in docker
->docker run -e key=value image

to start container
->docker start container_id

to stop container
->docker stop container_id

to remove container
->docker rm container_id
->to remove docker it should be removed first of all

execute command in container
->docker exec -it container_id bash
->to start a terminal in docker container


to see all the running container
->docker ps

to see all the container running as well as not running
->docker ps -a


->to build a docker file










Make a docker file Dockerfile
Some of the command(Watch fireship video)
FROM IMAGE           ->make container of this image
RUN CONMMAND         ->run command on this command
COPY SOURCE DESTINATION ->conpy file to container
ENTRYPOINT []  ->run command automatically after container is started
CMD [] =>run command 
EXPOSE port =>to expose file
WORKDIR DIRECTRY  ->Switch to directry in container all the work will be in this directry
COPY . .      ->copy all the file of location . to the container . except the file and folder of .dockerignore







The COPY command in Docker is used to copy files and directories from your local file system into a Docker image.

Copy all files and folders from the current directory to the destination in the container:
COPY . /path/to/destination

Copy a specific file from the current directory to the destination in the container:
COPY ./filename.extension /path/to/destination

Copy an entire folder from the current directory to the destination in the container:
COPY ./foldername /path/to/destination

Copy only the contents of a folder (not the folder itself) from the current directory to the destination in the container:
Dockerfile
Copy code
COPY ./foldername/ /path/to/destination








MAKE file .dockerignore
->inside that file
->Exclude files and directories from Docker build context to optimize image size and build speed.
nodemodules/




Building the docker file
docker build -t IMAGENAME DOCKERFILELOCATION





->docker file and composer file should be in root directry of my projects for example in django in manage.py directry




PUBLISHING THE DOCKER IMAGE IN DOCKER
->make docker image of name username/imagename
->docker login
->docker push username/imagename





DOCKER COMPOSER
->to run muntiple image in same cotainer 
make docker-compose.yml
inside this file name

->to use dockercompose with our file:

to make this container we use
=>sudo docker compose up

to remove all the image from container
=>sudo docker compose down

to run it in background
=>sudo docker -d compose up





VOLUMES IN CONTAINER  =>s
=>docker run -it -v HOST_MACINE_FOLERNAME:CONTAINER_FOLDERNAME IMAGENAME
eg:docker run -it -v /home/nirajan/Downloads/backup:/home/app ubuntu

=>all the files and folders of /app will be in /backup and all the files and folders of /backup will be in /app
=>use cases:
1)to take backup . even the container is deleted files amd folders of /app will be in /backup
2)to delete container only not its data
3)to make a new container with same data
